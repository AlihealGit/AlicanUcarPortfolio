The Board includes ESP-32 MCU, SSR Relay Trigger Mechanism, Microphone Module, 74HC595 Buffer IC for Leds, Buzzer, 555 Timer and J-K Flip Flop for Delay Button Circuit (hold 3 seconds to activate and deactive to power connection), and BNO055 9-DOF Orientation IMU.

# Rocket

The BOX is designed with a purpose of establishing a communication web in the earthquake. As, in the earthquakes, telecommunication webs go down, the BOX plans to create a bluetooth mesh with mobile application, and solve the communication problem. The users' mobilephones will be slaves and The BOX will be the master point. Also, 

I worked with Alchemy Smart Technologies. They wanted me to make a The BOX prototype to use in presantations. Also, I made a similar device to the BOX and gave it to Prof. Dr. Erdin BOZKURT to catch Earthquake accelaration patterns and measure Bridge Loads from vibrations.

Here are the some videos:

# Ground Station

The ground statin is created with the .NET Framework 4.7.2. I learned to use OpenGL and angular transition matrixes to create an animated rocket to show angles that received from the Flight Control Card. Also, the rocket model in the Ground Station original model of the our rocket.
