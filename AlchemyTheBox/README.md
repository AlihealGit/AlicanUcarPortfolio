The BOX is designed with a purpose of establishing a communication web in the earthquake. As, in the earthquakes, telecommunication webs go down, the BOX plans to create a bluetooth mesh with mobile application, and solve the communication problem. The users' mobilephones will be slaves and The BOX will be the master point. Also, the BOX has a secondary purpose providing Smart house features.

I worked with Alchemy Smart Technologies. They wanted me to make a The BOX prototype to use in presantations. Also, I made a similar device to the BOX and gave it to Prof. Dr. Erdin BOZKURT to catch Earthquake accelaration patterns and measure Bridge Loads from vibrations.

Here are the some videos:
